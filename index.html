			<h4>Background</h4>
			<p>If you are like me you look at hundreds of web pages every day. If so haven't you sometimes felt like you just wanted to sketch down a note about the page really quick?</p>
			<p>Sometimes it's because you are reviewing the page for some client. Or sometimes you just want to take a note related to a specific web page so that you keep your busy mind together when researching something.</p>
			<p>I really felt the need of some kind of tool, so I tried a lot of different tools.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-sm-6 col-ls-6">
			<h4>Story behind Notely</h4>
			<p>I didn't really fall in love with any of the tools I found. Some tools makes it possible to grab the page from the browser and then annotate it. But then you leave the browser where you spend the most of your time.</p>
			<p>Other tools made it possible to add notes within the page, but then they where in the way when you didn't want to see them. Because of these reasons I created Notely as a small weekend project.</p>
