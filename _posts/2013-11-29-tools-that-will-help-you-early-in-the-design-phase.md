I thought I would write a series of posts about tips and tricks I use in my design process. I will cover the design process itself but also a lot of tools and methods I use to produce the right artifacts in order to take me to the next level in the design process. This first article will be about the early stages of the design process.

So I don't know about you but at least before I do any design there are a few things I try to do in all my projects and that is setting some kind of context around the design area. I try to collect as much information as input for the design as possible. I love working with e.g. personas. But persona creation can be very time consuming. Especially if you are serious about how they are created and use deep interviews as the method for collecting the data to build them.

In many project I sadly don't have time to do personas in a proper way. Then wen I get the assignment or when I start my own projects I try to start of with what I call a brain dump. A brain dump is exactly what it sounds like. I try to just dump every thing that comes up in my mind regarding the design subject on paper. What that would be differs a lot based on the project at hand of course. But some things I try to think about is. Value proposition (USPs), Minimum Valuable Product (MVP - which features needs to be included as bare minimum), Target/User Group, Technology at hand, product/feature life cycle, etc.

For the product/feature life cycle I try to think about it as a marriage and its different phases. 

-   Discovery - How the users find out about the product
-   Dating - First time usage and experience
-   Marriage - How to make the users become loyal
-   Divorce - How to win back users if they start to use another product
-   End of life - What strategy to use in order to make it live longer. Enhancing to old product or develop a new

I used to write down all of this on paper, but recently I have found a fantastic tool that makes it so easy to just dump what ever pops up in your mind in no specific order or structure. Then you can easily rearrange and structure your thoughts using drag and drop afterwards. The tool is called [XMind](http://www.xmind.net) and is a free mind mapping tool. Now I use XMind all the time. I think it's so powerful. To view/create mind maps on iPad I use a tool called [Mindo](http://www.laterhorse.com/mindo/). It supports importing exporting XMind format also so it's perfect when I'm on the move away from my computer.

When it comes to visualizing your first ideas some people go directly for graphic design tools like Photoshop, etc. I don't think that is such a good idea. I order to get the right kind of feedback early on I think it's better to create basic sketches, maybe even hand drawn on paper. If you go to close to final product from day one I think the discussions will be more focused on e.g. on how the branding should be applied and other questions about shape and color. Although I think that is important in order to create a stunning user experience, I think first what you want feed back on is the concept it self. Not so much the graphical presentation.

To create these first concept visualizations I tend to make a lot of sketch pickups. Often I draw on paper but sometimes it's important to be able to create mock-ups that you can interact with. In order to do this I use a bunch of different tools except from pen and paper. I will try to list the one I like best.

When it comes to designing mobile apps I actually use an iPhone/iPad app to create clickable mockups. The first one is [Popapp](https://popapp.in/) that makes it possible to draw mock-ups on paper and then take photos of the drawing that later are turned into clickable mock-ups. Another way of doing this which I use quite a lot is to use my favorite mock-up tool [Omnigraffle](http://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle) to create clickable pdf files which I then upload to my iPhone/iPad using [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com). If you don't use Dropbox yet I suggest you check it out.

The reason why I like Omnigraffle so much is that you can create all types of mock-ups, everything from sketch to pixel perfect. You also have stencils with prebuilt assets that you can share with anybody. You even have a store, [Graffletopia](https://www.graffletopia.com), where you can buy or download free stencils. One alternative to Omnigraffle could be Balsamiq Mockups. The big difference is first the price but also the capabilities to generate pixel perfect design and drawing your own shapes. In Omnigraffle you can do all that but in Balsamic you need to stick to what you have. I have tried a bunch of other tools but these are the ones I use all the time.

When it comes to web concepts I almost only use Omnigraffle because of its ability to export clickable html mockups. Basically what it does is to export every page in the document as an image map with clickable regions. This makes it possible to really easy create mock-up web pages that gives you a very good feeling of how the final result will be. I use it a lot together with [Notely](/) (of course :-) to collect notes and feedback.

Even if I prefer doing sketches early on in the design process over pixel-perfect design, I think it's important to be able to get feedback on the graphical presentation. In order to get feedback I usually do mood-boards with images/screenshots which I think represents the style I have in mind for the final result. When you have a mood-board you can get feedback and change direction without even having to design anything yourself. To create mood-boards I have found the nice service [Pinterest](http://www.pinterest.com). With Pinterest you can create and share mood-boards of your own, both public and private boards. You can also search and find other users public boards, that you can reuse directly without any fuzz. I like it a lot!

Basically this how I start the design process and the tools I use. If you have any comments of feedback you would like to share with me feel free to write a comment below. I definitely would like to know what you all use and if you find this tips useful. If so stay tuned for more useful tips in next post in the series.
