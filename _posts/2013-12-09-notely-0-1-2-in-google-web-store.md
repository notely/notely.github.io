In this version I have focused on adding the possibility to capture a page with notes as an image that you can share with others. Notly will capture the entire page not only the visible part and open the result as a PNG in a new tab. Then it's up to you to print, save it or share it as you wish. Other than that I have focused on some usability improvements and bugs.

Change log:

-   Add links to github project in options page - enhancement
-   Change the archive icon to the one used on notely.github.io - bug, cosmetic
-   Modal overlay don't work - bug
-   Export notes by taking screen shot of entire page using captureVisibleTab - enhancement
-   Images in getting started miss responsive class - bug
-   Add spinner while capturing screen - enhancement
-   Add pagination to the blog on notely.github.io - enhancement
-   Add back link in options page when you have navigated into a page - enhancement
-   Add success alert when you have imported JSON in the import view - enhancement
