Hello World Notely Blog! This is the first post in the new blog. I thought I would write a little bit about my experience of building blogs on different platforms. This blog is build using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and hosted on [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com). Normally I build blogs based on [Wordpress](wordpress.org), but during the process of making this blog I found out that there are some similarities but also big differences in building a blog using this two very different technologies. First of all Jekyll use ruby and markdown to create static pages and Wordpress use php and a database to create dynamic pages. In this post I will try to highlight the differences and give some nice suggestions of framework to use.

Recently I have been doing some Wordpress sites. A developer portal and a blog for the company I work at. When we decided to build those sites on Wordpress we looked at making the development suck a little bit less. Therefore we looked at writing our theme using OOP based on php 5.4 and using a template engine for rendering pages and posts. Looking back I can't think or doing it another way. So now when I was looking in to making a blog for Notely I was pleased to see a similar solution at least from a templating point of view.

Let's start by talking a little bit more about the php stuff. I have recently been forced to do some php projects again. I switched to Node.js for a lot of my other projects, but now I had to use php again, mainly because of the hosting solution. To make that transition suck a little bit less I looked around for good php framework and found some good ones in order to get a proper MVC pattern. As as substitute of [Express](http://expressjs.com), I found [Slim](http://www.slimframework.com) and [Silex](http://silex.sensiolabs.org) micro-frameworks for building REST-style applications for the controller part. For rendering views I used [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org) and for models I have tried different ORM-frameworks, e.g. [PHPActiverecord](http://www.phpactiverecord.org). I think with these framework php development wasn't so bad actually.

Now when the task was to develop some new Wordpress sites I hoped I could use some of the nice frameworks. The controller and model part is of course the core of Wordpress itself and the way you extend or implement specific functionality is by implementing your own theme, plug-ins and widgets. So I couldn't really find use of Slim or Silex. If you ever have tried to build a Wordpress theme the official way you know it's a nightmare. A lot of the work is done by poking around in various template files and using global functions to register hooks for your custom functionality. Man it sucks big time. So the proper way to go about it is of course to try to get it more OOP by encapsulating the code in your own classes. I started to do that but I still ended up mixing html in my php code which is not nice either. Because I have used Twig to separate html from php I ended up looking for a solution to use Twig with Wordpress and found [Timber](http://jarednova.github.io/timber/). With Timber writing Wordpress themes was a joy. I was using [composer](http://getcomposer.org) for handling dev-dependencies and Timber as a bridge between DB and the templates making really good code/presentation separation.

Now looking at Github Pages as hosting for Notely I was a little bit skeptic about not having some kind of server side technology to create dynamic pages. Then I found out about Jekyll and the possibility to generate a blog using static pages. More then that I found out about Jekylls templating language [Liquid](http://docs.shopify.com/themes/liquid-basics). Which is very similar to Twig which made me happy. Because I have been using Twig in some of the previous projects I felt the learning curve was really small and I was up to speed really quick. The result is this, the Notely blog built using Jekyll and hosted on Github Pages.

Let me know if you have some more experience of some of the above mentioned php frameworks or of Jekyll or Github Pages. Otherwise stay tuned for other related writings or updates regarding the development of Notely.
